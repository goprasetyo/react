# Simple React Examples #

This was made (very quickly) for a Girls Who Code study group to talk about setting up a very simple React project and some Semantic UI.

# Walkthrough #

There are 4 lessons. Each is accessed by uncommenting the corresponding `import` line in [`src/index.js`](/src/index.js).

To start live compilation, use

``` sh
./node_modules/.bin/webpack --watch
```

To host the webserver, use

```sh
./node_modules/.bin/http-server
```

## Lesson 1: Hello World ##

This is a simple Hello World in React. Nothing too special here.

## Lesson 2: Semantic UI ##

Here we introduce React Semantic UI, an easy way to create beautiful apps

## Lesson 3: Router and Redux ##

We introduce React Router and Redux. React Router allows browsing. Redux adds the ability to store data in a monitorable way.

## Lesson 4: Full App ##

Now we put nice Semantic UI Styling on our router/redux app.
